INSTRUCTIONS:
Open up caerostrisMain and hit run. relayNode simulates several router-like relay nodes that broadcast all received messages, but does not broadcast them if they have already received a message with an ID the same as they have received. IDs are assigned separately to the originator of the message and are completely random. They are represented here by 8 random characters at the beginning of the message.
Inside of the main program, each relay node has its own port that all information travels to it from, representing a single physical connection. The idea of 'strands' is not implemented here, as that would require multiple listening ports per node per strand in order to implement properly. Only a single strand is implemented, really. The userNodes will send out pre-input messages put inside the code. They listen to 2 different relay nodes and the information broadcast over them, and print messages out that they receive.
